# Projekt City

Projekt City is a unique and expansive Minecraft project that operates without funding and is entirely free to play for everyone. Our mission is to develop an easily navigable Minecraft world for everyone, while paying a lot of attention to details and flawless work. Within "Projekt City," we are constructing a large map that features a city, an airport, a hotel, and much more, with meticulous attention to detail and precision. We enhance the gameplay through intricate redstone creations and commands.
The Projekt City map spans 1,164 meters in width and 1,833 meters in length, covering a total area of 2,133,612 square meters*, making it a very large Minecraft project! Our current efforts are focused on developing the airport and hotel, which occupy a significant portion of the map.
All versions after 4.1 are in English and will remain so until the project's completion, as adding other languages is a significant undertaking. We plan to introduce additional languages, such as German, French, and Italian, after completing the project to enhance accessibility for more players.

To provide detailed information, we have launched a website where players can find essential details and ask questions. We strive to address player requests swiftly and professionally, aiming to create a bug-free world. We encourage you to report any bugs or errors on our Discord server or forum. We are committed to enhancing our professionalism and skills in building, redstone, and commands to becom to become more professional, more accurate and better!

Thank you for your support,
